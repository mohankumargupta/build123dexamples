# Answers to questions

There is a lot of information buried in a number of different sources:

1. 

1. Can you mix algebra and builder mode

No but yes.

I was initially attracted to build123d because of algebra mode, but I recommend builder mode because having friends using Fusion360 it reads like the text version of the timeline of steps.

Once you have exited the build context, you get
the part/sketch/line by accessing that property on the builder(also accessible inside the builder).
